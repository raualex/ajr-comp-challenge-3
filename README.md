- Alexander Rau -

Project Guideline Requirements:

- Basic static site setup with `index.html` and `styles.css`

- Site must be responsive

- Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: `[initials]-comp-challenge-[challenge number] (i.e. “bt-comp-challenge-3”)`

- Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.

- Push your final work to `github pages`.

Description and Notes:

For this challenge, I stuck pretty close to the comp, as there are a lot of moving pieces, and this took quite a lot of time to build.  I mirrored the colors provided, but I did take some liberty with my icon selection, trying to get icons that represented the areas they would, in theory, link to.  I also took that idea of what each area is and does on the page into consideration when writing the aria-labels for my HTML tags.  I tried to get them as informative as conversational as possible.  The only creative license I took with this, besides the icons, is that the job profile presented on the page is for Douglas Reynholm, from the television show: the IT Crowd.  Otherwise, this sticks as strictly to the comp as I could.  This site is responsive, and I have offered hover states for most of the buttons that would be clickable, if this were an actual, live, webpage.  I used a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox for all elements on the page, and I have included Normalize CSS, as well, for cross-browser compatibility.
